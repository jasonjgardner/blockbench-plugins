# EMF Animation Addon

This is an addon plugin for Ewan Howell's `CEM Template Loader` plugin <span style="color:dodgerblue">https://ewanhowell.com/plugins/cem-template-loader</span>

This plugin adds support for the extra animation functions and variables used in the Entity Model Features (**EMF**) Mod 
- <span style="color:dodgerblue">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features</span>
- <span style="color:dodgerblue">https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features</span>

These extra features will not work when using these models in OptiFine.

>*Tip: you can have both EMF & OptiFine models in the same resource-pack by putting the EMF only models in the EMF override directory `assets/minecraft/emf/cem/`. If you don't use EMF only features then `assets/minecraft/optifine/cem` is recommended.*

A full list of all EMF animation functions and variables can be found <span style="color:dodgerblue">[**here**](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/.github/emf_animation.txt)</span>  
you can also see them in the EMF mod's in-game config screen under models -> Animation math details.

For **all** EMF features, including how to export modded entity models for use in blockbench, see the <span style="color:dodgerblue">[**EMF Feature Guide**](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)</span>

Plugin is current for EMF v2.0.2
