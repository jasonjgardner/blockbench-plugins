**Texture stitcher** is a plugin that allows you to take currently imported textures in the **Textures** tab and combine (stitch) them into a single texture.

This is useful when you need to convert/export the textures for specific format that doesn't support multiple textures (Bedrock Model, GeckoLib/AzureLib, BBS mod, etc.).

You can access this feature by right clicking anywhere in the **Textures** tab and clicking **Stitch all textures** option.

**IMPORTANT**: be really careful when you mix **Box UV** with **Per-face** UV modes! It can greatly inflate the size of the texture for the sake of working correctly with **Box UV** elements!
